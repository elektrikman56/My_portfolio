                    <p>
                        During my four-month tenure at the Kocaeli City Hospital project, I served as a Technical 
                        Site Lead, managing the deployment of advanced automation and infrastructure systems. Unlike 
                        a standard internship, this role involved full-time professional responsibility, where I moved 
                        rapidly from technical orientation to leading large-scale on-site operations. I was entrusted 
                        with the oversight of critical healthcare environments, ensuring that the hospital’s complex 
                        electronic and automation backbone met rigorous medical and industrial standards.

            <h3>Technical Leadership & Operational Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Workforce Supervision:</strong> I directly managed and coordinated a technical team of 
                10 to 15 specialized workers. My responsibilities included daily task delegation, quality control 
                of installations, and ensuring that all on-site activities aligned with the master project 
                timeline.</li>
                <li><strong>Operating Room (OR) Automation:</strong> I took a lead role in the installation and 
                routing of automation systems for operating theaters. This included the calibration and control 
                of differential air pressure systems and climate control units, which are critical for maintaining 
                sterile environments and patient safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Integration:</strong> I oversaw the technical wiring and 
                device connectivity within ICUs and neonatal units, managing the integration between bedside 
                medical sensors and the central hospital monitoring network.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure & Panel Engineering:</strong> My early phase involved the systematic 
                placement of automation control panels and the implementation of complex cable routing strategies 
                (above-ceiling systems) across multiple floors, ensuring organized and serviceable infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mini Part of Hospital Automation Project:</h3>

            </div>
            

            <h3>Project Coordination & Corporate Representation</h3>
            <p>
                As a key member of the technical team, I represented my firm in high-level project tracking and 
                coordination meetings. Being the primary person responsible for the automation progress on my 
                assigned floors, I provided status reports, addressed technical bottlenecks, and collaborated with 
                other engineering disciplines (mechanical, civil, and electrical) to ensure seamless system integration.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Impact</h3>
            <p>
                This role significantly enhanced my leadership capabilities and technical expertise in Building 
                Management Systems (BMS) and healthcare-specific automation. Managing a large team in a high-stakes 
                environment like a city hospital sharpened my problem-solving skills, technical reporting accuracy, 
                and my ability to deliver complex engineering solutions under intense operational pressure.
